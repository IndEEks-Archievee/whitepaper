What Is a White Paper?
A white paper (whitepaper) is an informational document, usually issued by a company or not-for-profit organization, to promote or highlight the features of a solution, product, or service. White papers are often written as sales and marketing documents used to entice or persuade potential customers to learn more about or purchase a particular product, service, technology or methodology.


White papers are designed to be used as a marketing tool before a sale, and not as a user manual or other technical document developed to provide support to the user after making a purchase.


[Important: White papers may also be technical documents elaborating on a new invention or product offering.]
